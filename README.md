Lesson 1: Iterations

**Binary gap**

A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.

For example, number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2. The number 529 has binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3. The number 20 has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1. The number 15 has binary representation 1111 and has no binary gaps. The number 32 has binary representation 100000 and has no binary gaps.

Write a function:

    def solution(N)

that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.

For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation 10000010001 and so its longest binary gap is of length 5. Given N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].

Lesson 2: Arrays

**Odd occurrences in array**

A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The array contains an odd number of elements, and each element of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value, except for one element that is left unpaired.

For example, in array A such that:

    A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9
    A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7
    A[6] = 9

the elements at indexes 0 and 2 have value 9,
the elements at indexes 1 and 3 have value 3,
the elements at indexes 4 and 6 have value 9,
the element at index 5 has value 7 and is unpaired.
Write a function:

    def solution(A)

that, given an array A consisting of N integers fulfilling the above conditions, returns the value of the unpaired element.

For example, given array A such that:

    A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9
    A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7
    A[6] = 9

the function should return 7, as explained in the example above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an odd integer within the range [1..1,000,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
all but one of the values in A occur an even number of times.

**Cyclic rotation**

An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is moved to the first place. For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right by one index and 6 is moved to the first place).

The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.

Write a function:

def solution(A, K)

that, given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.

For example, given

    A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
    K = 3
the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made:

    [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
    [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]
    [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
For another example, given

    A = [0, 0, 0]
    K = 1
the function should return [0, 0, 0]

Given

    A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    K = 4
the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4]

Assume that:

N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.

Lesson 90: Lessons from Indeed Prime 2015 challenge

**Flood depth**

You are helping a geologist friend investigate an area with mountain lakes. A recent heavy rainfall has flooded these lakes and their water levels have reached the highest possible point. Your friend is interested to know the maximum depth in the deepest part of these lakes.

We simplify the problem in 2-D dimensions. The whole landscape can be divided into small blocks and described by an array A of length N. Each element of A is the altitude of the rock floor of a block (i.e. the height of this block when there is no water at all). After the rainfall, all the low-lying areas (i.e. blocks that have higher blocks on both sides) are holding as much water as possible. You would like to know the maximum depth of water after this entire area is flooded. You can assume that the altitude outside this area is zero and the outside area can accommodate infinite amount of water.

For example, consider array A such that:

    A[0] = 1
    A[1] = 3
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 1
    A[4] = 2
    A[5] = 1
    A[6] = 5
    A[7] = 3
    A[8] = 3
    A[9] = 4
    A[10] = 2
The following picture illustrates the landscape after it has flooded:

![alt text](https://codility-frontend-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/task_static/flood_depth/static/images/auto/567c5fa410e5eec80b633b00c33eb77d.png)

The gray area is the rock floor described by the array A above and the blue area with dashed lines represents the water filling the low-lying areas with maximum possible volume. Thus, blocks 3 and 5 have a water depth of 2 while blocks 2, 4, 7 and 8 have a water depth of 1. Therefore, the maximum water depth of this area is 2.

Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum depth of water.

Given array A shown above, the function should return 2, as explained above.

For the following array:

    A[0] = 5
    A[1] = 8
the function should return 0, because this landscape cannot hold any water.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..100,000,000].
